### Hi there, i'm Full Stack Developer in web 2 and web3 ðŸ‘‹

My professional profile combines my knowledge of economics that allow me to identify value in processes, products or services; to have a holistic vision of a business and how this is inserted in a certain market âž• technical knowledge on web development, rest api, blockchain and smart contracts.

Since about 2016 that I knew of the existence of Bitcoin, first I was interested in the economic aspects which led me to study monetary issues. By immersing myself in Bitcoin I came up with the concept of Blockchain âž¡ Ethereum and Smart Contracts. There I understood the potential of programming through smart contracts, which allows through certain crypto instruments (cryptographic primitives such as hash, electronic signatures, asymmetric cryptography âž• market incentives = TOKENOMICS) the market design.

Today I am joining these 2 fields: TECHNOLOGY + ECONOMY .
