### Hi there 👋, I'm Mauro — Backend & Data Engineer

Backend Engineer with a background in Economics, focused on designing and building **scalable, data-intensive backend systems** and cloud-native architectures.

I have experience working on **backend platforms, data pipelines, and analytical systems**, translating business and data requirements into **robust, maintainable, and production-ready solutions**.

My work centers on **backend engineering and data systems**, using **TypeScript, Node.js, Python**, and **AWS**. I also have experience with **blockchain applications on EVM**, and I’m currently deepening my focus on **AI-driven systems, intelligent agents, and financial data analysis**, moving toward roles at the intersection of **software engineering, data, and quantitative finance**.

> I value clean architectures, clear abstractions, and systems designed to scale.
